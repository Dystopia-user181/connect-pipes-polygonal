		<span class="c-game-rules">
			I recommend beginners to start with the triangle board first, which is the easiest.
			The next easiest is the square board. Those looking for a challenge can try the other boards.
			<br>
			<br>
			The game's inspiration is taken from many other similar puzzle games, particularly
			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.puzzle-pipes.com/">this one.</a>
			As there hasn't been any attempts to generalise the game to any regular polygonal board yet, this
			version implements just that.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			For those struggling with the game, here is a basic set of rules or observations:
			<br>
			1. Try to consider every single possible rotation of a polygon. This should be sufficient for
			most cases.
			<br>
			2. Each pipe ending must correspond to another one.
			<br>
			3. Those of you more familiar with graph theory will recognise that the formal goal of this game is
			to build a <i>spanning tree</i> between all "nodes", represented here by polygons.
